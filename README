This project is part of the Udacity **Data Scientist** nanodegree program.  
The dataset used consists of user interaction logs from the fictional music streaming app **Sparkify**.

Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to analyze user behavior and develop a predictive model to identify users at risk of churning (canceling their subscription). 

Installation:
The following Python packages are required to run the code in this project:
- see attached **requirements.txt** file

To install these packages, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install pyspark pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

File Descriptions:
- **Sparkify_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow, including data loading, exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- **sparkify_log_small.json**: JSON dataset containing user interaction logs, such as user actions, session details, song play data, and additional technical information.

Results:
- Key behavioral indicators of churn include lower interaction frequency, shorter session durations, and reduced engagement.
- A churn prediction model was developed, with the Gradient-Boosted Tree classifier achieving the best performance. This model yielded an accuracy of approximately 85% and an F1 score indicating reliable predictive ability.
- Feature analysis revealed that song play frequency, session counts, and interaction types are significant indicators for identifying at-risk users.
